[4](https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/blog/common-testing-problems-pitfalls-to-prevent-and-mitigate/)

1. `Selection of wrong performance testing tools`: choosing a tool that does not match the system requirements, the test objectives, 
the test environment, or the test budget can result in inaccurate or incomplete performance testing data. 
It is important to evaluate different tools and select the one that best suits the system under test and the performance testing goals.
2.  `Lack of proper test strategy and test coverage`: having a *clear* and *comprehensive test strategy* and *test plan* is essential for conducting effective performance testing. 
The test strategy should *define the test objectives*, the *test scope*, the *test scenarios*, the *test data*, the *test metrics*, 
the *test environment*, the *test schedule*, and the *test roles and responsibilities*. 
The test plan should ensure that all the critical aspects of system performance are covered by appropriate test cases and test scripts.
3. `Time and budget constraints`: performance testing can be *time-consuming* and *costly*, especially if it involves large-scale or complex systems.  
Performance testing *should be planned and executed early in the software development lifecycle8 to avoid delays or rework. 
Performance testing *should also be allocated sufficient resources and budget* to ensure its quality and effectiveness.
4. `Lack of knowledge about need for performance tests`: sometimes, stakeholders or developers may not understand or appreciate 
the importance of performance testing for *ensuring system quality and user satisfaction*. 
They may underestimate or ignore the potential risks or impacts of poor system performance on the business or the users. 
Performance testing should be communicated and justified to all the relevant stakeholders and developers as a vital part of software testing.
5. `Improper analysis of performance test outcomes`: *collecting and analyzing performance testing data is not enough*; 
it is also important to *interpret* and *report* the *data correctly and meaningfully*. 
Performance testing data should be *compared with the predefined performance criteria* or *benchmarks* to determine if the system meets the expected performance standards. 
Performance testing data should also *be presented in a clear and concise manner* to highlight the key findings and recommendations for improvement.
6. `Difficulty in conducting tests on production environment`: sometimes, it may not be feasible or desirable to conduct performance tests on the actual production environment due to security, availability, or cost reasons. 
In such cases, it is important to *create a realistic and representative test environment* that simulates the production environment as closely as possible. 
The test environment should have similar hardware, software, network, configuration, load, and data as the production environment.

## Best practices for testing performance:

Best practices for performance testing are the guidelines or recommendations that can help you conduct effective and efficient performance testing of your software applications. 
Some of the best practices for performance testing are:

1. `Test early and often`: performance testing should be **integrated into the software development lifecycle** and **performed** **throughout** the **development stages**. 
This can help you identify and resolve performance issues early, avoid rework and delays, and ensure that the system meets the expected performance standards.
2. `Define clear and realistic performance goals and criteria`: performance testing should have **well-defined objectives**, **scope**, **scenarios**, **data**, **metrics**, and **thresholds** that align with the business and user requirements. 
Performance **goals** and **criteria** should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound.
3. `Select appropriate performance testing tools and techniques`: performance testing should use tools and techniques that match the system characteristics, 
the test environment, the test objectives, and the test budget. Performance testing tools should be able to simulate realistic user behavior, 
generate different types of load, monitor various aspects of system performance, and analyze and report performance testing results.
4. `Consider users, not just servers`: performance testing should focus on the user experience and satisfaction, not just on the system resources and capacity. 
Performance testing should measure how the system responds to user requests or actions under different load and network conditions. 
Performance testing should also capture user interface timing along with server metrics.
5. `Analyze and report performance testing results accurately and effectively`: performance testing should collect and analyze performance testing data to determine 
if the system meets the predefined performance goals and criteria. Performance testing should compare the data with the benchmarks or baselines to 
identify any deviations or bottlenecks. Performance testing should also present the data in a clear and concise manner to highlight the key findings 
and recommendations for improvement.

These are some of the best practices for performance testing that can help you ensure the quality and reliability of your software applications.ðŸ˜Š

## Parameters of testing performance that we consider to monitor:

he parameters monitored during performance testing are the indicators or measurements that can help you evaluate the performance of your software application under different load and network conditions. 
Some of the key performance testing metrics and why they matter are:

[2](https://stackify.com/ultimate-guide-performance-testing-and-software-testing/)
[3](https://www.qaoncloud.com/performance-testing-metrics/)

1. `Processor usage`: the amount of time the processor spends executing non-idle threads. 
This metric can help you identify if the processor is overutilized or underutilized by the application processes or threads. 
A high processor usage can indicate a performance bottleneck or a resource contention issue.

2. `Memory usage`: the amount of physical memory available to processes on a computer. 
This metric can help you identify if the memory is sufficient or insufficient for the application processes or threads. 
A low memory availability can indicate a memory leak or a resource contention issue.

3. `Disk time`: the amount of time the disk is engaged in executing requests. 
This metric can help you identify if the disk is fast or slow in processing the input/output operations. 
A high disk time can indicate a performance bottleneck or a resource contention issue.

4. `Disk queue length`: the number of requests waiting to be processed by the disk. 
This metric can help you identify if the disk is overloaded or underloaded by the input/output operations. 
A high disk queue length can indicate a performance bottleneck or a resource contention issue.

5. `Network throughput`: the amount of data transferred over the network per unit of time. 
This metric can help you identify if the network bandwidth is adequate or inadequate for the application data transfer. 
A low network throughput can indicate a network congestion or a network configuration issue.

6. `Network latency`: the time taken for a packet of data to travel from one point to another on the network. 
This metric can help you identify if the network delay is acceptable or unacceptable for the application response time. 
A high network latency can indicate a network congestion or a network configuration issue.

7. `Response time`: the time taken for the system to respond to a user request or action. 
This metric can help you evaluate if the system performance is satisfactory or unsatisfactory for the user experience and satisfaction. 
A high response time can indicate a poor system performance or a poor user interface design.

8. `Throughput`: the number of transactions or requests processed by the system per unit of time. 
This metric can help you evaluate if the system performance is efficient or inefficient for the business requirements and expectations. 
A low throughput can indicate a poor system performance or a poor business logic design.

9. `Error rate`: the percentage of transactions or requests that fail due to errors. 
This metric can help you evaluate if the system performance is reliable or unreliable for the user expectations and satisfaction. 
A high error rate can indicate a poor system performance or a poor error handling design.

These are some of the parameters monitored during performance testing that can help you assess and improve your software application performance.ðŸ˜Š

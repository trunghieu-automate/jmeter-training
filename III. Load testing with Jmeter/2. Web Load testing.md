# Web Load testing:

## What is web load testing?

Web load testing is a type of performance testing that simulates the expected traffic on a web application or website and measures its response time, throughput, errors, and resource utilization. Web load testing can help you identify and resolve performance bottlenecks, ensure scalability and reliability, and improve user satisfaction. Web load testing is a complex and iterative process that requires careful planning, execution, and analysis.

Some of the best practices for web load testing are:

- `Define clear and realistic goals and objectives for the test`: You should know what you want to achieve from the test, what metrics you want to measure, what success criteria you want to use, and what risks you want to mitigate.
- `Identify and simulate the target user population and behavior`: You should analyze the usage patterns of your real users, such as their geographic location, browser type, device type, network speed, etc. You should also create realistic user scenarios that cover the most common and critical user journeys on your web application or website.
- `Choose an appropriate workload model and test duration`: You should estimate the expected number of concurrent users, requests per second, and data volume for your web application or website. You should also decide how long to run the test and how to vary the load over time (e.g. steady state, ramp-up, spike, etc.).
- `Prepare your load generators and test environment`: You should ensure that your load generators are capable of generating the desired load without affecting the test results. You should also configure your test environment to match your production environment as closely as possible, including the hardware, software, network, security, etc.
- `Monitor and analyze the test results`: You should collect and visualize the relevant performance metrics from your web application or website, such as response time, throughput, errors, CPU usage, memory usage, etc. You should also compare the test results with your goals and objectives and identify any performance issues or improvement opportunities.

## which configuration often used mostly in web load testing?

According to the Apache JMeter Userâ€™s Manual, some of the configuration elements that are mostly used for web load test plan are:

- `Thread Group`: This element defines the number of users, the ramp-up period, and the number of iterations for the test. It is the starting point of any test plan.
- `HTTP Request Defaults`: This element allows you to set default values for HTTP requests, such as server name, port number, protocol, etc. It can save you time and make your test plan more maintainable.
- `HTTP Cookie Manager`: This element stores and sends cookies like a web browser. It can help you handle sessions and authentication in your web test plan.
- `HTTP Header Manager`: This element lets you add or override HTTP request headers, such as User-Agent, Accept-Encoding, etc. It can be useful for simulating different browsers or devices in your web test plan.
- `HTTP Cache Manager`: This element simulates browser cache behavior and reduces the network load by avoiding requests for resources that are already cached. It can improve the realism and performance of your web test plan.

There are other configuration elements that you can use for web load testing, depending on your specific needs and scenarios. You can find more information about them in the JMeter documentation

## Which metric is considered for web load testing?

There are many metrics that can be considered for web load testing, depending on the goals and objectives of the test. Some of the common metrics are:

- `Response time`: This metric measures the amount of time it takes for the web server to respond to a given request. It can be divided into sub-metrics, such as time to first byte (TTFB), time to last byte (TTLB), time to render (TTR), etc. Response time is influenced by factors such as network latency, server capacity, application logic, etc. Response time is one of the most important metrics for user satisfaction and conversion rates.
- `Throughput`: This metric measures the amount of data transferred between the web server and the client per unit of time. It can be expressed in terms of requests per second (RPS), transactions per second (TPS), bytes per second (BPS), etc. Throughput is influenced by factors such as network bandwidth, server performance, content size, caching, etc. Throughput is an indicator of the scalability and efficiency of the web application.
- `Error rate`: This metric measures the percentage of requests that result in errors, such as HTTP status codes 4xx or 5xx, timeouts, exceptions, etc. Error rate is influenced by factors such as server load, application bugs, configuration issues, etc. Error rate is an indicator of the reliability and robustness of the web application.
- `Resource utilization`: This metric measures the amount of system resources (such as CPU, memory, disk, network, etc.) consumed by the web server and the client during the test. Resource utilization is influenced by factors such as server configuration, application design, load intensity, etc. Resource utilization is an indicator of the performance and capacity of the web server and the client.

These are some of the basic metrics that can be used for web load testing. There are also other metrics that can be used for specific scenarios or purposes, such as availability, concurrency, latency, scalability, etc. You can use various tools and frameworks to collect and analyze these metrics, such as JMeter, LoadNinja, LoadRunner

## Somw samples of web load testing scenarios/ definition

1. A Load testing scenario for website is:
- `Goal`: To test the performance of the login functionality under normal and peak load conditions
- `User population`: 1000 users from different locations, using different browsers and devices
- `User scenario`: The user navigates to the login page, enters a valid username and password, clicks on the login button, and logs out
- `Workload model`: A ramp-up model with 10 users starting every 10 seconds until reaching 1000 users, then a steady state for 10 minutes, then a ramp-down model with 10 users stopping every 10 seconds until reaching zero users

## All commonly used work load model in Web load test? and how to setup each in Jmeter (just definition)and give examples?

- `Steady state model`: This model simulates a constant and uniform load on the web application or website. It can help you measure the baseline performance and stability of the web application or website. 
> You can use a thread group with a fixed number of threads (users) and a long loop count (how many times to repeat the test). 
>> For example, if you want to simulate 1000 users for 30 minutes, you can use a thread group with 1000 threads and a loop count of 1800 (assuming each iteration takes 1 second).
- `Ramp-up model`: This model simulates a gradual and linear increase in the load on the web application or website. It can help you measure how the web application or website handles increasing load and identify the point of saturation or failure. 
> You can use a thread group with a high number of threads (users) and a long ramp-up period (how long it takes to start all the threads). 
>> For example, if you want to simulate 5000 users in 10 minutes, you can use a thread group with 5000 threads and a ramp-up period of 600 seconds.
- `Ramp-down model`: This model simulates a gradual and linear decrease in the load on the web application or website. It can help you measure how the web application or website recovers from high load and releases the resources.
> You can use a thread group with a high number of threads (users) and a short loop count (how many times to repeat the test). 
>> For example, if you want to simulate 5000 users for 10 minutes, you can use a thread group with 5000 threads and a loop count of 600 (assuming each iteration takes 1 second).
- `Stress model`: This model simulates an excessive and unrealistic load on the web application or website. It can help you measure the limits and boundaries of the web application or website and identify any potential errors or vulnerabilities. 
> You can use multiple thread groups with different workload models and scenarios.
>> For example, if you want to simulate different types of users and transactions on your web application or website, you can use different thread groups with different numbers of threads, ramp-up periods, loop counts, samplers, etc. You can also use controllers to control the execution logic and flow of your test plan.
- `A spike model`: This model simulates a sudden and large increase in the load on the web application or website. It can help you measure how the web application or website handles extreme load and identifies the point of breakdown or failure. 
> A spike model can be created by using a thread group with a high number of threads (users) and a short ramp-up period (how long it takes to start all the threads). 
>> For example, if you want to simulate a spike of 5000 users in 5 minutes, you can use a thread group with 5000 threads and a ramp-up period of 300 seconds. You can also use a timer to control the delay between each request. For example, if you want to simulate 10 requests per second, you can use a constant throughput timer with a target throughput of 600 requests per minute.

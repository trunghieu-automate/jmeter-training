# Using Jmeter in Load testing?

## What is Load testing? and its purpose?
Load testing is a type of performance testing that simulates a real-world load on a system or software and measures its response and behavior. 
The purpose of load testing is to determine the maximum capacity of the system or software and identify any performance issues or bottlenecks that may affect its functionality, reliability, or user experience. 
Load testing can help you evaluate how your system or software handles normal and peak load conditions, such as the number of concurrent users, requests, transactions, etc. 
Load testing can also help you plan for future growth and scalability of your system or software by projecting the expected load and performance under different scenarios. 
Load testing is an essential part of ensuring the quality and performance of your system or software before it goes live.

## Why using Jmeter for Load Testing?

JMeter is a popular tool for load testing because it has many advantages, such as:

- It is free and open source, which means you don’t have to pay any licensing fees or depend on any vendor for support or updates.
- It is platform independent, which means you can run it on any operating system that supports Java.
- It supports various protocols and applications, such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, JDBC, SOAP, REST, etc., which means you can test different types of systems and servers with JMeter.
- It has a user-friendly and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI), which means you can easily create and modify test plans, add test elements, configure settings, run tests, and view results.
- It has a record and playback feature, which means you can record your actions on a browser or an application and replay them as a test script with JMeter.
- It has a customizable and extensible architecture, which means you can modify the source code, add plugins, use scripting languages, or integrate with other tools to enhance the functionality and performance of JMeter.
- It supports distributed load testing, which means you can run tests on multiple machines simultaneously and generate a large load on the system under test.
- It has a good community support, which means you can find many online tutorials, forums, blogs, and documentation to help you learn and use JMeter.
- JMeter can help you perform load testing effectively and efficiently by simulating realistic user scenarios and measuring various performance metrics

## Basic setup Jmeter for a Load testing scenario?

The followings are basic web load setup in Jmeter:

1. `Download and install JMeter` on your computer. You will need Java 6 or later installed as well.
2. `Open JMeter and create a new test plan` by clicking on the “File” menu and selecting “New”.
3. `Add a thread group` to your test plan by right-clicking on the test plan and selecting “Add” -> “Threads (Users)” -> “Thread Group”. 
4. `Configure the thread group settings` according to your load testing scenario. 
For example, you can set the number of threads (users), the ramp-up period (how long it takes to start all the users), and the loop count (how many times to repeat the test).
5. `Add an HTTP request sampler` to your thread group by right-clicking on the thread group and selecting “Add” -> “Sampler” -> “HTTP Request”. 
6. `Configure the HTTP request sampler` settings according to your web testing scenario. 
For example, you can set the protocol (HTTP or HTTPS), the domain name or IP address of the web server, the port number, the path of the web page or resource, the method (GET or POST), and any parameters or headers if needed
7. `Add a listener` to your test plan by right-clicking on the test plan and selecting “Add” -> “Listener”. 
A listener collects and displays the results of your test in various formats, such as graphs, tables, reports, etc. 
You can add multiple listeners to your test plan to view different aspects of your test results.
8. `Configure the listener` settings according to your preferences. 
For example, you can choose what data to save or display, how to aggregate or filter the results, how to format or export the results, etc.
9. `Run your test plan` by clicking on the “Run” menu and selecting “Start”. 
You can also use the green triangle button on the toolbar. 
You will see the test running in JMeter and the results displayed in the listeners you added.
10. `Analyze your test results` using the listeners you added. 
You can also generate an HTML report from your test results by clicking on the “Tools” menu and selecting “Generate HTML Report”. 
You will need to provide a CSV file containing your test results and a folder where to save the HTML report.

## Load testing best practice in Jmeter:

Some of the best practices for load testing in JMeter are:

- `Use the latest version` of JMeter and Java, as they may have performance improvements and bug fixes.
- `Use non-GUI mode` to run your load tests, as the GUI mode consumes more resources and may affect the accuracy of your results.
- `Disable or remove any unnecessary elements`, such as listeners, graphs, assertions, etc., that may consume more memory or CPU during your load test. 
You can also use CSV format to save your test results instead of XML format, as it is more compact and faster to write and read.
- `Use variables, functions, and regular expressions` to parameterize your test plan and make it more realistic and dynamic. 
You can also use CSV data set config or other configuration elements to read data from external sources.
- `Use timers, logic controllers, throughput controllers`, etc., to control the flow and pace of your test plan and simulate different user scenarios and behaviors.
- `Use assertions` to validate the responses of your requests and check for any errors or failures. 
You can also use response assertion or duration assertion to set a threshold for acceptable response time or size.
- `Use distributed testing` to generate a large load on your system under test by running JMeter on multiple machines simultaneously. 
You can also use cloud-based load testing services, such as BlazeMeter, to scale up your load testing without setting up your own infrastructure.
- `Use the HTML report` or other tools to analyze your test results and identify any performance issues or bottlenecks. 
You can also use backend listener or other plugins to monitor your test results in real-time.

These are some of the best practices for load testing in JMeter that can help you create and run effective and efficient load tests

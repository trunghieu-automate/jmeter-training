## Jmeter Server

Jmeter server is a Java application that runs on a machine and listens for commands from a Jmeter client. 
The Jmeter client can send a test plan to the Jmeter server and instruct it to run the test locally or as part of a [distributed testing](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/remote-test.html) setup. 
The Jmeter server then executes the test plan and sends the results back to the Jmeter client. 
The Jmeter server can also collect and report the performance metrics of the machine it is running on, such as CPU, memory, disk and network usage.

To run Jmeter server, you need to have Java installed on the machine and set the JMETER_HOME environment variable to point to the Jmeter installation directory. 
You also need to configure the firewall and proxy settings if necessary. 
Then you can run the jmeter-server script (jmeter-server.bat for Windows or jmeter-server for Linux) in the /bin directory of Jmeter. 
The Jmeter server will start listening on port 1099 by default, unless you change it in the jmeter.properties file4.

To connect Jmeter client to Jmeter server, you need to specify the hostname or IP address of the Jmeter server in the remote_hosts property in the jmeter.properties file on the client machine. 
You can also specify multiple Jmeter servers separated by commas if you want to run a distributed test. 
Then you can use the GUI or CLI mode of Jmeter client to run a remote test or a distributed test.

## Remote or Distributed performance testing in JMeter

Remote or distributed performance testing in Jmeter is a feature that allows users to distribute the load generated by a test plan across multiple machines. 
This feature is useful when a single machine is not powerful enough to generate the required load or when the test environment is distributed across multiple machines.

Remote or distributed performance testing in Jmeter follows the master-slave architecture, where one Jmeter instance acts as a master that controls and collects data from multiple Jmeter instances that act as slaves. 
The master sends the test plan to all the slaves and instructs them to run the test locally or as part of a distributed test. 
The slaves then execute the test plan and send the results back to the master. The master can then aggregate and analyze the results from all the slaves.

To perform remote or distributed performance testing in Jmeter, you need to configure and start the Jmeter server component on all the slave machines and specify their IP addresses in the remote_hosts property on the master machine. 
Then you can use the GUI or CLI mode of Jmeter on the master machine to run a remote test or a distributed test. 
You can also choose which slave machines to run or stop using the Run > Remote Start/Stop options in the GUI mode.

### Pros and cons of using distributed performance testing using Jmeter:

Distributed performance testing in Jmeter is a feature that allows users to distribute the load generated by a test plan across multiple machines. 
This feature has some benefits and drawbacks:

`Benefits`:
- It can help to achieve a higher number of concurrent users requesting the target server than a single machine can generate.
- It can help to reduce the risk of bottlenecks or resource constraints on a single machine by distributing the load across multiple machines.
- It can help to simulate a realistic load scenario by using different machines with different network conditions and locations.

`Drawbacks`:
- It requires some configuration and setup to run tests remotely or in distributed mode, such as firewall and proxy settings, remote_hosts property, SSL settings, etc.
- It requires more hardware and software resources to run Jmeter on multiple machines, which can increase the cost and complexity of the test environment.
- It does not allow modifying the test plan during the test run, which can limit the flexibility and adaptability of the test.

## What does option `Redirect Automatically` do in HTTP Request sampler?

The option Redirect Automatically in the HTTP Request sampler will check if the response of the server is a redirection. 
If this is true, it will redirect to the URL specified by the Location header in the response. 
This option will not consider each redirect as a separate request, so only one sample result will be generated for the original request and all the redirects.

This option can be useful if you want to follow the redirects automatically without creating additional samplers or listeners. 
However, this option may not work well with some servers that require cookies or authentication for redirection. 
In that case, you may need to use the Follow Redirects option instead, which will consider each redirect as a separate request and generate a sample result for each one.

## What is the difference between Redirect Automatically and Follow Redirects?

The difference between Redirect Automatically and Follow Redirects is that Redirect Automatically will not generate a sample result for each redirect, while Follow Redirects will. 
This means that Redirect Automatically will only show the final response after following all the redirects, while Follow Redirects will show the intermediate responses as well.

For example, if you send a request to https://example.com/a and the server responds with a 301 redirect to https://example.com/b, and then https://example.com/b responds with a 200 OK response, then:

If you use Redirect Automatically, you will only see one sample result with the URL https://example.com/a and the response code 200 OK. 
The redirect to https://example.com/b will not be shown in the sample result.
If you use Follow Redirects, you will see two sample results: one with the URL https://example.com/a and the response code 301 Moved Permanently, and another with the URL https://example.com/b and the response code 200 OK. 
The redirect to https://example.com/b will be shown in the first sample result.
The advantage of using Redirect Automatically is that it reduces the number of sample results and simplifies the test plan. 
The advantage of using Follow Redirects is that it shows more details about the redirection process and allows you to handle cookies or authentication for redirection.

## How do I handle cookies or authentication for redirection?

To handle cookies or authentication for redirection, you need to use the Follow Redirects option in the HTTP Request sampler and add a Cookie Manager or an Authorization Manager to your test plan. These elements will help you store and send the cookies or credentials required by the server for redirection.

A Cookie Manager is used to store and manage cookies sent by the server. It can also generate cookies based on the thread number or user-defined variables. You can add a Cookie Manager by right-clicking on the test plan or the thread group and selecting Add > Config Element > HTTP Cookie Manager.

An Authorization Manager is used to store and manage credentials for basic or digest authentication. It can also use variables or functions to generate dynamic credentials. You can add an Authorization Manager by right-clicking on the test plan or the thread group and selecting Add > Config Element > HTTP Authorization Manager.

`For example`: 

if you want to send a request to https://example.com/login and the server responds with a 302 redirect to https://example.com/home after setting a cookie and requiring basic authentication, then:

- You need to use the Follow Redirects option in the HTTP Request sampler to follow the redirect to https://example.com/home.
- You need to add a Cookie Manager to your test plan or thread group to store and send the cookie set by the server.
- You need to add an Authorization Manager to your test plan or thread group to store and send the credentials required by the server.

## How do I disable redirection?

To disable redirection, you need to uncheck both the Redirect Automatically and the Follow Redirects options in the HTTP Request sampler. This will make the sampler stop at the first response from the server and not follow any redirects.

This option can be useful if you want to test the redirection logic of the server or if you want to avoid unnecessary requests. However, this option may also cause some requests to fail or return incomplete results if the server expects the client to follow the redirects.

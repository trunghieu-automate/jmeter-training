# Jmeter controllers?

## What is Jmeter controller?

A Jmeter controller is a component that `controls` the `order and logic` of `how user requests are executed` in a test plan. 
There are different types of controllers in Jmeter, such as Simple Controller, Loop Controller, Transaction Controller, Module Controller, Random Controller, etc. 
Each controller has a specific purpose and functionality.

For example, a Loop Controller makes the user requests run a specified number of times or run forever2. A Module Controller allows you to reuse parts of your test plan as modules. A Transaction Controller measures the overall time taken to finish a test execution.

## How many controllers in Jmeter? 

According to the official JMeter documentation1, JMeter has two types of controllers: `Samplers` and `Logical Controllers`. 
- Samplers are used to send requests to a server and receive responses. 
- Logical Controllers are used to control the order and logic of how samplers are executed.

There are many kinds of logical controllers in JMeter, such as Simple Controller, Loop Controller, Transaction Controller, Module Controller, Random Controller, etc. Each logical controller has a specific purpose and functionality. For example, a Loop Controller makes the user requests run a specified number of times or run forever. A Module Controller allows you to reuse parts of your test plan as modules.

## What does each controller do?

Each controller in Jmeter has a different function and behavior. Here is a brief summary of some of the controllers:

- `Simple Controller`: This is just a container for user requests. 
It does not affect the test execution in any way.
- `Transaction Controller`: This measures the overall time taken to finish a test execution. 
It can also generate a parent sample that includes the time taken by timers and pre/post processors.
- `Loop Controller`: This makes the user requests run a specified number of times or run forever.
- `While Controller`: This makes the user requests run until a condition is false. 
The condition can be based on a variable or a function.
- `ForEach Controller`: This makes the user requests run for each value of a variable. 
The variable can be extracted from a previous response using a post processor.
- `If Controller`: This makes the user requests run only if a condition is true. 
The condition can be based on a variable or a function.
- `Once Only Controller`: This makes the user requests run only once per thread.
- `Throughput Controller`: This controls how often the user requests are executed. 
It can be based on a percentage or a total number of executions.
- `Interleave Controller`: This picks one user request randomly and makes it run in each loop of the thread.
- `Random Controller`: This picks one user request randomly and makes it run once per loop of the thread group.
- `Random Order Controller`: This shuffles the order of the user requests before each iteration of the thread group.
- `Module Controller`: This allows you to reuse parts of your test plan as modules. 
You can select another controller from your test plan and make it run as part of your current controller.

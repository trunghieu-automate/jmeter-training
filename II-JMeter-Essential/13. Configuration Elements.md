# Configuration Elements

## Introduction
JMeter configuration elements are the variables that are used later by the samplers. They can be used to set up defaults and variables which are used by other elements like controllers, listeners, assertions, etc. during the test12. Some examples of configuration elements are:

## All default configuration element of Jmeter (v5.5)
Here are some brief descriptions for each configuration element:

- `CSV Data Set Config`: This element allows you to read a file of parameter values and use them in your test.
- `DNS Cache Manager`: This element allows you to clear the DNS cache of JMeter and use a custom DNS resolver.
- `FTP Request Defaults`: This element allows you to set default values for FTP requests, such as server name, port number, username, password, etc.
- `HTTP Authorization Manager`: This element allows you to manage the authorization headers for HTTP requests that require authentication.
- `HTTP Cache Manager`: This element allows you to simulate browser cache behavior for HTTP requests.
- `HTTP Cookie Manager`: This element allows you to manage cookies for HTTP requests. It can store and send cookies like a browser.
- `HTTP Header Manager`: This element allows you to add or override HTTP request headers.
- `HTTP Request Defaults`: This element allows you to set default values for HTTP requests, such as server name, port number, protocol, etc.
- `Java Request Defaults`: This element allows you to set default values for Java requests, such as class name, method name, parameters, etc.
- `JDBC Connection Configuration`: This element allows you to configure a database connection pool for JDBC requests.
- `JDBC Request Defaults`: This element allows you to set default values for JDBC requests, such as query type, query string, variable names, etc.
- `JMS Point-to-Point Configuration`: This element allows you to configure the JMS provider and destination for JMS point-to-point requests.
- `JMS Publisher Configuration`: This element allows you to configure the JMS provider and destination for JMS publisher requests.
- `JMS Subscriber Configuration`: This element allows you to configure the JMS provider and destination for JMS subscriber requests.
- `Keystore Configuration`: This element allows you to configure a keystore for SSL client certificates.
- `LDAP Extended Request Defaults`: This element allows you to set default values for LDAP extended requests, such as server name, port number, base entry DN, scope, etc.
- `LDAP Request Defaults`: This element allows you to set default values for LDAP requests, such as server name, port number, base entry DN, scope, etc.
- `Login Config Element`: This element allows you to specify the username and password for login requests.
- `Random Variable`: This element allows you to generate a random variable and store it in a specified variable name.
- `Simple Config Element`: This element allows you to specify any property or variable and its value. It can be used to override JMeter properties or define custom variables.
- `TCP Sampler Config`: This element allows you to set default values for TCP requests, such as server name, port number, timeout, etc.
- `User Defined Variables`: This element allows you to define your own variables and assign them values. You can use these variables in other elements by using the syntax ${variable_name}.


## Mostly used configuration in web test plan?
  
- `HTTP Request Defaults`: This element allows you to set default values for HTTP requests, such as server name, port number, protocol, etc. It can save you time and make your test plan more maintainable.
- `HTTP Cookie Manager`: This element stores and sends cookies like a web browser. It can help you handle sessions and authentication in your web test plan.
- `HTTP Header Manager`: This element lets you add or override HTTP request headers, such as User-Agent, Accept-Encoding, etc. It can be useful for simulating different browsers or devices in your web test plan.
- `HTTP Cache Manager`: This element simulates browser cache behavior and reduces the network load by avoiding requests for resources that are already cached. It can improve the realism and performance of your web test plan.

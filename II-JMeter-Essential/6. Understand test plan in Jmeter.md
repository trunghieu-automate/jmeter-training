## What's Jmeter's `test plan`?
A test plan is a **document** that **describes** a series of **steps** Jmeter will execute when run. 
A test plan **can be visualized** as your Jmeter script for running tests. 
A test plan **consists** of test elements such as **thread groups**, **logic controllers**, sample generating controllers, listeners, timers, assertions, and configuration elements. 
A test plan can have one or more thread groups, which are the starting points of any test plan. 
Each thread group can have one or more samplers, which are the requests that Jmeter sends to the target server. 

Each sampler can have one or more logic controllers, which control the order and logic of execution of the samplers. 
Each sampler can also have one or more listeners, which collect and display the results of the test. 
Each sampler can also have one or more timers, which introduce delays between the requests. 
Each sampler can also have one or more assertions, which validate the responses from the server. 
Each sampler can also have one or more configuration elements, which provide additional settings for the test.

A test plan can be created and edited using Jmeter’s graphical user interface (GUI) mode. 
You can add and remove elements to a test plan by right-clicking on an element in the tree and choosing a new element from the "add" list. 
You can also load and save elements from file by choosing the "merge" or "open" option. 
You can configure each element by selecting it and modifying its controls in Jmeter’s right-hand frame.

A test plan can be run using Jmeter’s command-line interface (CLI) mode or non-GUI mode. 
This mode is recommended for running load tests as it consumes less memory and CPU resources than GUI mode. 
You can run a test plan using CLI mode by using the -n option and specifying the test plan file name and other parameters.

## What's Jmeter's `test plan`?
A test plan is a **document** that **describes** a series of **steps** Jmeter will execute when run. 
A test plan **can be visualized** as your Jmeter script for running tests. 
A test plan **consists** of test elements such as **thread groups**, **logic controllers**, sample generating controllers, listeners, timers, assertions, and configuration elements. 
A test plan can have one or more thread groups, which are the starting points of any test plan. 
Each thread group can have one or more samplers, which are the requests that Jmeter sends to the target server. 

Each sampler can have one or more logic controllers, which control the order and logic of execution of the samplers. 
Each sampler can also have one or more listeners, which collect and display the results of the test. 
Each sampler can also have one or more timers, which introduce delays between the requests. 
Each sampler can also have one or more assertions, which validate the responses from the server. 
Each sampler can also have one or more configuration elements, which provide additional settings for the test.

A test plan can be created and edited using Jmeter’s graphical user interface (GUI) mode. 
You can add and remove elements to a test plan by right-clicking on an element in the tree and choosing a new element from the "add" list. 
You can also load and save elements from file by choosing the "merge" or "open" option. 
You can configure each element by selecting it and modifying its controls in Jmeter’s right-hand frame.

A test plan can be run using Jmeter’s command-line interface (CLI) mode or non-GUI mode. 
This mode is recommended for running load tests as it consumes less memory and CPU resources than GUI mode. 
You can run a test plan using CLI mode by using the -n option and specifying the test plan file name and other parameters.

## We must define test plan firstly in Jmeter?

Yes, a test plan is the top-level element in JMeter and describes a series of steps that JMeter will execute when run. 
It is the first thing you must define when creating a test in JMeter. A complete test plan will consist of one or more Thread Groups, logic controllers, sample generating controllers, listeners, timers, assertions, and configuration elements.
It defines the structure and flow of the test, as well as the configuration settings for each element.

## what are the input parameters should be considered when creating a testplan in Jmeter?

Some input fields to consider when creating a test plan in JMeter include:

1. `Name`: Provide a name for your test plan. 
It could be the name of a project or test case.
2. `Comments`: Provide a comment.
3. `User Defined Variables`: Define static variables for values that are repeated throughout a test, such as server names 1.
4. `Functional Testing`: If selected, it will cause JMeter to record the data returned from the server for each sample 2.
5. `Thread Group`: This element controls the number of threads JMeter will use to execute your test. The controls for a thread group allow you to set the number of threads, set the ramp-up period, and set the number of times to execute the test.
6. `Ramp-Up Period`: This property tells JMeter how long to take to “ramp-up” to the full number of threads chosen.
7. `Loop Count`: This property tells JMeter how many times to repeat your test.

## How many testplan can be created in Jmeter?
There is *no limit* to the number of test plans you can create in JMeter. 
You can create and save as many test plans as you need for your testing purposes. 
Each test plan is saved as a separate file, so you can organize and manage them as you see fit.

## How to organize testplans?
Organizing your JMeter test plans is a matter of personal preference and can depend on the specifics of your testing needs. 
Here are some suggestions that might help you organize your test plans:

- `Use descriptive names`: Give your test plans descriptive names that reflect their purpose or the scenario they are testing. 
This will make it easier to find and identify the test plan you need.
- `Use a consistent naming convention`: Use a consistent naming convention for your test plans to make it easier to identify and organize them. 
For example, you could use a prefix to indicate the type of test (e.g., “LoadTest_”, “StressTest_”) or the application being tested (e.g., “MyApp_”).
- `Use folders`: Organize your test plans into folders based on their purpose, application, or any other criteria that makes sense for your testing needs. This will make it easier to find and manage your test plans.
- `Use version control`: Consider using a version control system to manage your test plans. 
This will allow you to track changes to your test plans over time and make it easier to collaborate with others.

## How to save a testplan in Jemter?

From the “File” menu, select “Save Test Plan As…”.

## What is .jmx extension/ file?

A .jmx file is a JMeter test plan file. 
It is an XML file that contains all the information about a JMeter test plan, including its structure and the configuration of its elements. 
When you save a test plan in JMeter, it is saved as a .jmx file. 
You can then open this file in JMeter to continue working on your test plan or to run your tests.

## Allow to edit .jmx file outside form Jmeter?

Yes, you can edit a .jmx file outside of JMeter using a text editor. 
Since a `.jmx file` is an `XML file`, you can open it in any text editor and make changes to the XML code. 
However, you should be careful when editing a .jmx file outside of JMeter, as making changes to the XML code can potentially break the test plan if not done correctly. 
It is generally recommended to make changes to your test plan within JMeter to ensure that the test plan remains valid and functional. 

## Creating testplans best practices in Jmeter?

Here are some best practices for creating a test plan in JMeter:

- `Use the latest version of JMeter`: The performance of JMeter is constantly being improved, so it is recommended to use the most up-to-date version.
- `Use the correct number of threads`: The number of threads you use will affect JMeter’s performance. 
Make sure to size the number of threads correctly to avoid inaccurate results.
- `Use assertions`: Use response assertions for every request to ensure that your server is returning the expected results.
- `Use timers correctly`: Timers can help you control the pacing of your test and simulate realistic user behavior.
- `Reuse code with controllers`: Use Module and Simple Controllers to reuse code and make your test plan more manageable.
- `Be realistic with your simulations`: Make sure your test plan simulates realistic user behavior and scenarios.
- `Consider using Groovy for scripting`: Groovy is a scripting language that is integrated with Java and can make your tests less verbose and more streamlined .
- `Generate reports after the test has completed`: Generate your reports after the test has completed to avoid impacting JMeter’s performance during the test.

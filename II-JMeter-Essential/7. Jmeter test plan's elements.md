# Jmeter Test plan's elements

## What is test plan's elements

A JMeter test plan is made up of several elements that work together to define the testing scenario.
Here are the main elements of a test plan in JMeter:
1. `Thread Group`: This is the ***starting point*** of any JMeter test plan. 
It represents a group of users that will simulate the load on the system being tested. 
The thread group element controls the number of threads JMeter will use to execute your test. 
The controls for a thread group allow you to set the number of threads, set the ramp-up period, and set the number of times to execute the test
2. `Sampler`: This element represents the actual request that will be sent to the system being tested.
3. `Assertion`: This element validates the response of a sampler. 
For example, Response Assertion, Duration Assertion, Size Assertion, etc.
4. `Timer`: This element controls the delay between requests.
5. `Listener`: This element collects and displays the results of the test.
6. `Configuration Element`: Configuration elements are used to set up default values and variables for other elements in the test plan. 
For example, you can use an HTTP Request Defaults configuration element to set default values for all HTTP Request samplers in your test plan.
7. `Login Controller` : Logic Controller is one of the elements that can be added under a Thread Group. 
This element controls the flow of the test plan. For example, Loop Controller, If Controller, Switch Controller, etc
8. `Post and Pre Processor`: They are used to modify or transform the samplers in their scope. 
A pre Processor executes some action before making a sampler request, such as setting user parameters, parsing HTML links, or running a JSR223 script. 
A post Processor executes some action after making a sampler request, such as extracting data from the response, validating the response, or handling the result status. 
You can add a post or pre Processor by right-clicking on a thread group or another element in the tree, and choosing a post or pre Processor from the “add” list. 
They can help you customize and enhance your test plan according to your needs.
9. `Test fragment and non-test fragment` : special elements in JMeter that can help you create modular and reusable test plans. 
A test fragment is a container that holds other elements such as samplers, controllers, processors, etc., but it does not execute by itself. 
It can only be executed when it is referenced by a module controller or an include controller from another thread group. 
A module controller allows you to call a test fragment within the same test plan. 
An include controller allows you to call a test fragment from an external test plan. 
A non-test fragment is similar to a test fragment, but it can also hold configuration elements such as user defined variables, cookie manager, etc. 
A non-test fragment can be used to define common settings for multiple test plans and avoid duplication. 
You can add a test fragment or a non-test fragment by right-clicking on the test plan and choosing “add” -> “test fragment” or “non-test element” -> “test fragment” respectively.

## What is ramp-up period in Jmeter's thread group?

The ramp-up period in JMeter tells JMeter how long to take to “ramp-up” to the full number of threads chosen. 
If 10 threads are used and the ramp-up period is 100 seconds, then JMeter will take 100 seconds to get all 10 threads up and running. 
Each thread will start 10 (100/10) seconds after the previous thread was begun. 
Ramp-up needs to be long enough to avoid too large a workload at the start of a test and short enough that the last threads start running before the first ones finish (unless one wants that to happen). 
Start with Ramp-up = number of threads and adjust up or down as needed.

***For example***, if you have 10 threads and a ramp-up period of 100 seconds, JMeter will take 100 seconds to create and start all 10 threads. 
Each thread will start 10 seconds after the previous thread was started. 
This means that the first thread will start immediately, the second thread will start 10 seconds later, the third thread will start 20 seconds later, and so on until all 10 threads are started.

The ramp-up period is important because it helps you control the load on the system being tested. If you set a short ramp-up period, all threads will start at almost the same time, which can create a sudden spike in load. If you set a longer ramp-up period, the load will increase gradually.

## Which elements is required?

A minimal test plan will consist of the Test Plan, a Thread Group and one or more Samplers. 
All controllers and samplers must be under a thread group. 
Other elements, such as Listeners, may be placed directly under the test plan, in which case they will apply to all the thread groups.

## How many way to add element into a test plan in Jmeter? 

There are several ways to add elements to a test plan in JMeter:

1. `Right-clicking on an element in the tree`: You can add elements to a test plan by right-clicking on an element in the tree and choosing a new element from the “Add” list.
2. `Loading elements from a file`: You can also load elements from a file and add them to your test plan by choosing the “Merge” or “Open” option.
3. `Dragging and dropping`: You can drag and drop elements from one location in the test tree to another.
4. `Copy and paste`: You can copy elements in JMeter’s test tree by right-clicking on the element you want to copy and selecting “Copy” from the context menu. 
Then, right-click on the location where you want to paste the copied element and select “Paste” from the context menu.

## Different between `Merge` and `Open` options?

- The `Merge` option allows you to merge the elements from the file into your existing test plan. 
This means that the elements from the file will be added to your test plan, but any existing elements in your test plan will remain unchanged.
- The `Open` option, on the other hand, replaces your entire test plan with the elements from the file. 
This means that any existing elements in your test plan will be removed and replaced with the elements from the file

## does drag and drop copy element to new place?

Dragging and dropping elements in JMeter’s test tree moves the elements to the new location. 
This means that the element is removed from its original location and placed in the new location.

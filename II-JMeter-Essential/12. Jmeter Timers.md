# Jmeter Timer

## introduce Jmeter timer

JMeter timers are test elements that ***allow you to pause the execution of a thread*** for a specified amount of time. They are useful for ***simulating the “think time” of real users***, which is the time they spend between interactions with a web application. By using timers, you can ***make your load test more realistic*** and ***avoid overloading the server*** with too many requests at once.

There are different types of timers in JMeter, each with its own logic and parameters. Some of the most common ones are:

- `Constant Timer`: This timer pauses the thread for a fixed amount of time that you specify in milliseconds. For example, if you set it to 5000 ms, it will wait for 5 seconds before each sampler in its scope.
- `Uniform Random Timer`: This timer pauses the thread for ***a random amount of time*** that is uniformly distributed between a minimum and a maximum value that you specify in milliseconds. For example, if you set it to 3000 ms and 7000 ms, it will wait for a random time between 3 and 7 seconds before each sampler in its scope.
- `Gaussian Random Timer`: This timer pauses the thread for ***a random amount of time*** that follows a normal (Gaussian) distribution with a mean and a deviation that you specify in milliseconds. For example, if you set it to 5000 ms and 1000 ms, it will wait for a random time around 5 seconds with a standard deviation of 1 second before each sampler in its scope.
- `Poisson Random Timer`: This timer pauses the thread for a ***random amount of time*** that follows a Poisson distribution with a lambda value that you specify in milliseconds. For example, if you set it to 5000 ms, it will wait for a random time with an average of 5 seconds before each sampler in its scope.

## What is Timers's scope?
The scope of a timer in JMeter determines which samplers are affected by the timer’s delay. A timer can have different scopes depending on where it is placed in the test plan. For example:
- If a timer is placed directly under a test plan, it has a global scope and applies to all the thread groups and samplers under that test plan.
- If a timer is placed under a thread group, it has a thread group scope and applies to all the samplers under that thread group.
- If a timer is placed under a parent controller, it has a parental scope and applies to all the samplers under that parent controller and its child controllers.
- If a timer is placed under a child controller, it has a child scope and applies to only the samplers under that child controller.
- If a timer is placed as a child element of a sampler, it has a sampler scope and applies to only that sampler.

## What is the difference between constant and random timers?

You can use the drag-and-drop feature of JMeter GUI to move the timer element to change its scope. You can also use the cut-and-paste or copy-and-paste options from the right-click menu. You can check the scope of a timer by looking at its icon in the test plan tree. A green triangle indicates that the timer is affecting more than one sampler, while a blue triangle indicates that the timer is affecting only one sampler.

## Does Timer effect response time result of in scope sampler?

No, the timer does not affect the response time result of the sampler. The timer execution time is not included in the sampler execution time. For example, if the timer pauses the thread for 1 second and the sampler takes 3 seconds to complete, the response time result will be 3 seconds, not 4 seconds.

However, if you want to include the timer execution time in the response time result, you can use a Transaction Controller and check the option “Include duration of timer and pre-post processors in generated sample”. This will create a parent sample that will include the timer and sampler execution times.

## best practices for using Jmeter Timers?

Some of the best practices for using JMeter timers are:

- Use timers to simulate realistic user behavior and avoid overloading the server with too many requests at once.
- Choose the appropriate type of timer for your test scenario, depending on whether you need a fixed or a random delay between requests.
- Adjust the timer values according to your application’s expected response time and user’s think time.
- Use JMeter functions or variables to parameterize the timer values and make them dynamic.
- Use scripting timers such as JSR223 Timer or BeanShell Timer to implement custom logic for your delays.
- Be aware of the scope of your timers and place them in the right location in your test plan.
- Use Transaction Controller if you want to include the timer execution time in the response time result.
- Use as few listeners as possible and avoid using View Results Tree or View Results in Table listeners during the load test, as they consume a lot of resources.

## What's cripting Timer in Jmeter?

Scripting timers are timers that allow you to write your own code to calculate the delay between requests. They are useful when you need more flexibility and control over the timing logic than the other types of timers provide. You can use any scripting language that is supported by JMeter, such as Groovy, JavaScript, Python, etc. You can also use JMeter variables, functions and API in your code. Scripting timers are powerful tools, but they also require more skills and resources than the other timers. You should use them only when necessary and test your code carefully before running your test.

## What are the advantages and disadvantages of scripting timers?

Some of the advantages of scripting timers are:

- They provide more flexibility and control over the timing logic than the other types of timers.
- They support multiple scripting languages and allow you to choose the one that suits your needs and preferences.
- They allow you to use JMeter variables, functions and API in your code, which can make your code more dynamic and reusable.
- They can handle complex scenarios that may not be possible with the other types of timers.

Some of the disadvantages of scripting timers are:

- They require more skills and knowledge of scripting languages and JMeter API than the other types of timers.
- They can introduce errors or bugs in your code that may affect your test results or performance.
- They can consume more resources and CPU than the other types of timers, especially if your code is not optimized or efficient.
- They can make your test plan more difficult to maintain or debug, especially if your code is not well documented or structured.

## Introduction:

### What Is Distributed Performance Testing
Distributed performance testing means using multiple systems with ***the master-slave configuration*** to test a web application or a server's performance.

In this process, we'll use a local client as a master that handles the test execution using multiple remote clients, and each remote client acting as a slave will execute the test on our target server.

***Each slave system executes the load tests following the exact condition set by the master.*** Therefore, the distributed performance testing helps us achieve a higher number of concurrent users requesting the target server

In simple terms, the outline of the distributed performance testing using JMeter will look like:

## Setup

### Prerequisites:
We should follow a few prerequisites for a smooth setup and test run:

- Multiple computers with JMeter installed on each
- Firewalls on the systems are turned off, or required ports are opened for connection
> - By default, RMI uses a dynamic port for the JMeter server engine. This can cause problems for firewalls, so you can define the JMeter property server.rmi.localport to control this port number.
> - You also need to open the port you define as server_port, by default 1099, and the port you define as client.rmi.localport.
> - If the systems are not on the same subnet, you may also need to configure the RMI hostname settings.
- All systems (master/slave) are on the same subnet.
- JMeter on each system can access the target server.
> when you use JMeter for distributed testing, you need to make sure that each system that runs JMeter (either as a controller node or a worker node) can access the target server that you want to test. For example, if you want to test a web server with the URL https://example.com, then each JMeter system should be able to send requests to that URL and receive responses from it. This may require configuring the network settings, firewall rules, proxy settings, etc. on each JMeter system.
- Use the same version of Java and JMeter on all systems (master and slave).
- For simplicity, disable the SSL for RMI.
> - You can set the JMeter property server.rmi.ssl.disable to true in the jmeter.properties file or pass it as a command-line argument when starting JMeter.

> Note: Some security issues should be consider when disable SSL:
> - You may expose your communication to man-in-the-middle attacks that can intercept, modify or spoof your data.
> - You may lose the ability to authenticate the identity of the server or client you are communicating with, which can lead to impersonation or phishing attacks.
> - You may become vulnerable to older or weaker encryption algorithms that can be easily broken by attackers with sufficient computing power.
> - You may lose compatibility with some clients or servers that require SSL for secure communication.

> Note: What is RMI?
> - RMI stands for Remote Method Invocation. It is a Java technology that allows a remote object to invoke methods on another object across a network. JMeter uses RMI as the remote communication mechanism between the controller node and the worker nodes in distributed testing12. This allows the controller node to send the test plan and commands to the worker nodes, and receive the test results from them.

> Note: What is SSL?
> - SSL is a security protocol that encrypts data that is sent over the Internet between a web server and a web browser. It protects the privacy and integrity of the data and verifies the identity of the web server or browser. SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer

> Note: What is subnet?
> - A subnet, or subnetwork, is a network inside a network. It is a logical partition of an IP network into multiple, smaller network segments. Subnets make networks more efficient by reducing traffic and improving security

### Configure the Slave System.

On the slave system (re-look the picture above), we'll go to the jmeter/bin directory and execute the jmeter-server.bat file on Windows. Or, we can run the jmeter-server file on Unix.

### Configure the Master System.

1. Add remote_host (slave's ip address)
On the master system, we'll go to the jmeter/bin directory and edit the remote_hosts property in the jmeter.properties file to add IP addresses (comma-separated) of the slave systems:
```properties
remote_hosts=192.165.0.10,192.165.0.20,192.165.0.30
```
> Here, we've added three slave systems.
2. Check result on GUI mode:
So, by starting the JMeter (master) in the GUI mode, we can confirm all the slaves listed in the Run > Remote Start option:

![remote_hosts](https://www.baeldung.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/jmeter-slaves.png)

That's it! We're ready to start the JMeter master system to execute tests on the target server using multiple clients.

### Remote Testing:

1. Create test plan on master system.
2. Can run in GUI mode and non-GUI mode
3. Can start running single slave and all slave
- Single slave :

- All slaves
![all_slaves](https://www.baeldung.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/jmeter-start-all.png)

### Test results

Finally, we can see the test results in the local JMeter (master) once test execution finishes:
![master_results](https://www.baeldung.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/jmeter-master-results.png)

Also, on the remote JMeter systems (slaves), we can find logs about the start/stop of the test execution:

```log
Starting the test on host 192.165.0.10 @ Sun Oct 25 17:50:21 EET 2020
Finished the test on host 192.165.0.10 @ Sun Oct 25 17:50:25 EET 2020
```

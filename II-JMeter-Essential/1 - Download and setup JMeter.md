- Operating Systems: JMeter is a 100% Java application and should run correctly on any system that has a compliant Java implementation14. However, you may need to adjust some settings such as machine sizing, OS tuning, and Java heap size depending on your test plan and load scenario4.
- Optional: If you plan on doing JMeter development or using some advanced features, then you may need some optional packages such as Java Compiler, SAX XML Parser, Email Support, SSL Encryption, JDBC Driver, etc1. You can find more details on these packages and how to install them in the JMeter Classpath section of the user manual.

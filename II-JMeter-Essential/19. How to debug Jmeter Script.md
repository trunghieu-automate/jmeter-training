## How to debug Jmeter's script?
To debug JMeter script, you can use different tools and techniques such as:

1. Debug Sampler: This is a JMeter component that allows you to see the values of JMeter variables and properties at any point of your test plan. You can add it to your test plan by right-clicking on a node and selecting Add > Sampler > Debug Sampler. You can configure it to show only variables, only properties or both. You can also filter the variables or properties by prefix or regular expression. The debug sampler results are shown in the View Results Tree listener.
2. Debug Post-Processor: This is another JMeter component that allows you to see the values of JMeter variables and properties after a sampler execution. You can add it to your test plan by right-clicking on a sampler and selecting Add > Post Processors > Debug Post-Processor. You can configure it similarly to the debug sampler, but it also has an option to show the sampler properties. The debug post-processor results are shown nested under the parent sampler in the View Results Tree listener.
3. JSR223 Sampler: This is a JMeter component that allows you to execute custom code written in Groovy or other supported scripting languages. You can use it to debug your JMeter script by printing the values of variables or properties to the console or log file using println() or log.info() methods. You can also use it to perform assertions or validations on your script logic. You can add it to your test plan by right-clicking on a node and selecting Add > Sampler > JSR223 Sampler. You can write your code in the Script area and select the language from the drop-down list.

## What are some best practices for debugging JMeter scripts?
Some of the best practices for debugging JMeter scripts are:

- Use the View Results Tree listener to inspect the requests and responses, and test the extractors using the built-in testers for regex, json path, xpath, etc. You can access the testers from the drop-down menu on top of the requests12.
- Use the Log Viewer to monitor the script execution and see any errors or warnings in the console. You can turn on the log viewer from the top menu by following Options > Log Viewer. You can also view the jmeter.log file in the bin folder of JMeter installation12.
- Use the Debug Sampler or Debug Post-Processor to see the values of JMeter variables and properties at any point of your test plan. You can filter them by prefix or regex, and show only variables or properties or both23.
- Use the JSR223 Sampler to execute custom code written in Groovy or other scripting languages. You can print the values of variables or properties to the console or log file using println() or log.info() methods. You can also perform assertions or validations on your script logic3.
- Use Dummy Sampler to generate fake requests to try things without hitting a real server. You can use it to test your extractors, assertions, timers, etc. without affecting your server performance2

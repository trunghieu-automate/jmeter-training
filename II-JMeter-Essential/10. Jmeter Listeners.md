# Listerners

## What is Jmeter's listeners?
Jmeter Listerners are components that `display the results` of the load test in various formats, such as `tables`, `graphs`, `trees`, and `charts`. They help testers `analyze the performance` of the system under test and identify bottlenecks, errors, and other issues. Listeners `can be adjusted anywhere in the test`, including directly under the test plan.

## What does listener do? Can we generate report without setting up a Listerner?

- A listener is a component that shows the results of the samples that JMeter generates during a load test. They help testers analyze the performance of the system under test and identify bottlenecks, errors, and other issues. 
- You can generate a report without setting up a listener by using the `-l flag` in `CLI mode`. This flag creates a top-level listener for the test run that writes the results to a file specified by the flag. `The configuration` of this listener is `controlled by` entries in the file `jmeter.properties`. You can also use the `-g flag` to `generate an HTML report` from an `existing CSV or XML file`.

## What kind of listenrer does Jmeter provide?

Here are some examples of JMeter listeners and their scenarios:
- `View Results Tree`: This listener displays samples that the JMeter samplers generate, and the assertion results that are related to these samples. It provides parameters and data for each sample, such as request headers, response code, response body, etc. This listener is ***useful for debugging and validating the test script***.
- `View Results in Table`: This listener displays samples ***in a table format***, with columns for sample number, start time, thread name, label, sample time, status, bytes, latency, etc. It provides a quick overview of the test results and ***allows sorting*** by any column.`
- `Spline Visualizer`: This listener displays samples in a graph format, with a spline curve that shows the average response time of the samples over time. It also ***shows the maximum and minimum*** response times as horizontal lines. This listener is ***useful for visualizing the response time trends and variations***.
- `Response Time Graph`: This listener displays samples in a ***graph format***, with a *line chart that shows the response time of each sample over time*. It also *shows the average response time as a horizontal line*. This listener is useful for ***comparing the response times of different samples*** and ***identifying outliers***. 
- `Assertion Results`: This listener displays samples that failed any assertion in the test script. It *shows the sample label, response code, response message, failure message, and assertion type*. It also allows *viewing the request and response data of the failed samples*. This listener is ***useful for identifying and troubleshooting errors in the test script or system under test***.
- `Simple Data Writer`: This listener *writes samples to a file* in a specified format *(CSV or XML)*. It allows configuring which fields to write and whether to append or overwrite the file. This listener is ***useful for saving test results for later analysis or reporting***.
- `Flexible File Writer`: This listener *writes samples to a file* in a custom format. It allows configuring which fields to write using variables and functions, and how to format them *using separators and line endings*. It also allows *writing additional data such as headers or footers*. This listener is ***useful for creating custom output files that suit specific needs***.
- `Save Responses to a File`: This listener *saves the response data (body or headers) of each sample to a separate file*. It allows configuring the file name prefix, suffix, extension, and path. It also allows adding a timestamp or a number to the file name. This listener is ***useful for storing the response data for later inspection or verification***.

Some listerners above is not default for Jmeter, and can install by installing Jmeter Plugin Managers.

## Which listener is best for load testing?

No proper answer.

## Best practice for using listenters

Some best practices for using listeners are:
  
- `Use only the listeners that are relevant and necessary` for your load test. Do not add too many listeners or use listeners that consume a lot of resources, as they may affect the performance of your load test and JMeter.
- `Run your load test in non-GUI mode` and `save the results to a file`. Then use listeners to analyze the results after the test is finished. This will reduce the overhead on JMeter and improve the performance of your load test.
- `Use plugins that extend JMeter’s functionality and provide additional listeners` that are useful for load testing. For example, you can use the JMeter Plugins Manager to install plugins such as 3 Basic Graphs, Transactions per Second, PerfMon Servers Performance Monitoring, etc.
- `Use filters and settings` to customize the appearance and behavior of the listeners. For example, you can use regular expressions to filter out unwanted samples, change the colors or labels of the graphs, adjust the time intervals or scales of the charts, etc.
- `Use reports to generate and share the results` of your load test in a clear and concise way. You can use JMeter’s built-in HTML Reporting Dashboard or third-party tools such as BlazeMeter or LoadView to create interactive and comprehensive reports from your load test results.


## Which file extension does the `Response Time Graph` listener save?

The Response Time Graph listener can save the graph as an image file in PNG format. You can use the Save Graph button in the listener settings to save the graph to a file. You can also specify the file name and output folder by adding the full path or directory where you want to save the file. 
For example: D:\users\response_time_graph.png

## How can we specify `save repsonse to a file` listerner output folder in non-GUI mode run?

- Create `save repsonse to a file` listerner in GUI mode, then setup output folder in prefix name input.
- No flag support in GUI-mode

## What is the different between `Summary report` and `Aggregate report` Listeners in Jmeter?

The main difference between summary report and aggregate report in JMeter is that summary report does not show the median and percentiles values, while aggregate report does. Both reports show the same metrics such as label, samples, average, min, max, error%, throughput, etc. but aggregate report also shows the median (50% line), 90%, 95% and 99% percentiles. These values indicate the response time below which a certain percentage of samples fall. For example, the 90% percentile means that 90% of the samples have a response time less than or equal to this value.

The advantage of using aggregate report is that it provides more information about the distribution of the response times and helps to identify outliers or bottlenecks. The disadvantage is that it consumes more memory and resources than summary report, as it needs to store all the samples in memory to calculate the median and percentiles. Therefore, summary report is recommended for large tests or when memory is limited.

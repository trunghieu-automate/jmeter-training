# Post-Processor

## Introducing:
Post-processor is an element that executes some action after making a Sampler Request. For example, you can use a Post-processor to extract some values from the server response and save them in a variable for later use.

## List all default Post-processor in Jmeter 5.5:

According to official document, Jmeter 5.5 has the following Post-processor elements:

- `Regular Expression Extractor`: extracts values from the server response using regular expressions.
- `CSS/JQuery Extractor`: extracts values from the server response using CSS or JQuery syntax.
- `XPath Extractor`: extracts values from the server response using XPath expressions.
- `Result Status Action Handler`: allows the user to stop the thread or the whole test if the user request failed.
- `BeanShell Post Processor`: allows the user to run custom code after a sampler request.
- `JSR223 Post Processor`: allows the user to run custom code in various scripting languages after a sampler request.
- `JDBC Post Processor`: allows the user to execute a database query after a sampler request.
- `JSON JMESPath Post Processor`: extracts values from the server response using JSON Path expressions.
- `Boundary Extractor`: extracts values from the server response using start and end boundaries.
- `Debug Post Processor`: displays debug information about the sampler request and response.

## Json path expresstion?
A JSON Path expression is an expression language to filter JSON data. It is similar to XPath expression in XML but has limited features compared to XPath.

A JSON Path expression consists of a root object `($)`, followed by child operators `(.)` or `([ ])`, and followed by `field names` or `array indices`. You can also use `wildcards (*)`, `recursive descent (…)`, `filters (?)`, `slices (:)`, and `scripts ()` in a JSON Path expression.

For example, if you have a JSON object like this:
```json
{
   "store":{
      "books":[
         {
            "category":"reference",
            "author":"Nigel Rees",
            "title":"Sayings of the Century",
            "price":8.95
         },
         {
            "category":"fiction",
            "author":"Evelyn Waugh",
            "title":"Sword of Honour",
            "price":12.99
         }
      ]
   }
}
```
You can use the following JSON Path expressions to extract values from it:

- $.store.books[0].title -> returns “Sayings of the Century”
- $.store.books[*].author -> returns [“Nigel Rees”, “Evelyn Waugh”]
- $…books[?(@.price < 10)] -> returns the book object with price less than 10

#### JSONPath expression's excercise:
- Given json object below:
```json
{ "store": {
    "books": [ 
      { "category": "reference",
        "author": "Nigel Rees",
        "title": "Sayings of the Century",
        "price": 8.95,
        "sections": ["s1","s2","s3"]
      },
      { "category": "fiction",
        "author": "Evelyn Waugh",
        "title": "Sword of Honour",
        "price": 12.99,
        "sections": ["s4","s1","s3"]
      },
      { "category": "fiction",
        "author": "Herman Melville",
        "title": "Moby Dick",
        "isbn": "0-553-21311-3",
        "price": 8.99,
        "sections": ["s1"]
      },
      { "category": "fiction",
        "author": "J. R. R. Tolkien",
        "title": "The Lord of the Rings",
        "isbn": "0-395-19395-8",
        "price": 22.99,
        "sections": ["s8,s9"]
      }
    ],
    "time": {
      "starttime": "8:00",
      "endtime": "18:00"
    }
  }
}

```
**Task: write JSONPath expression to complete these task** 
```JSONPath
//get all books for store
$.store.books
                     
//get all sections from all books
$.store.books..sections

//get all authors of all books for store
$.store.book.author 
$.store.books[*]author

//get 3rd book record 
$.store.books[2]

//get first 2 books from the top
$.store.books[0,1]
$.store.books[:2]

//get last 2 books
$.store.books[-2:]

//get all books where author attribute equals to 'sam'
$.store.books[?(@.author='sam')]

//get all documents / sub documents (any level) where author attribute equals to 'sam'
$..books[?(@.author='sam')]

//get books where price is less than 10
$..books[?(@.price<'10')]

//filter all books with tag
$.store.books[?(@.tag)]

//find all books which contains section s1 or s2 (Use of Logical operator OR ( || )
$.store.books[?(@.sections[*]=='s1' || @.sections[*]=='s2' )]

//find all books where first section is s1 and second section is s2 (Logical operator AND ( && ))
$.store.books[?(@.sections[0]=='s1' && @.sections[1]=='s2' )]
```

## [`Json JMESPath Extractor`](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#JSON_JMESPath_Extractor)?

![Json JMES Path Element](https://jmeter.apache.org/images/screenshots/extractor/jmespath_extractor.png)

JSON JMESPath Extractor is a post-processor element that allows you to extract values from the server response using JMESPath expressions.

JMESPath is a query language for JSON that lets you specify the path to the value you want to extract. It supports various operators, functions, and filters to manipulate and filter JSON data. Learn more about [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/tutorial.html).

You can use JSON JMESPath Extractor to parse JSON responses and store the extracted values in JMeter variables for later use.

To use JSON JMESPath Extractor, you need to add it as a child element of the sampler that produces the response you want to parse. Then you need to configure the following settings:

- `Reference Name`: the name of the JMeter variable that will hold the extracted value.
- `JMESPath Expression`: the JMESPath expression that matches the value you want to extract.
- `Default Value`: the value to use if no match is found or an error occurs.
- `Match No.`: the number of matches to return. 0 means random, -1 means all.

For example, if you have a sampler that produces a JSON response like this:
```json
{
  "people":[
    {
      "name":"Alice",
      "age":25,
      "pets":[
        "dog",
        "cat"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name":"Bob",
      "age":30,
      "pets":[
        "fish",
        "bird"
      ]
    },
    {
      "name":"Charlie",
      "age":35,
      "pets":[
        "rabbit",
        "hamster"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
And you want to extract the name of the second person, you can add a JSON JMESPath Extractor with the following settings:

- Reference Name: person_name
- JMESPath Expression: people[1].name
- Default Value: NOT_FOUND
- Match No.: 1

Then you can use ${person_name} in other elements to refer to the extracted value, which will be “Bob” in this case

## Jmeter [XPath2 Extractor](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#XPath2_Extractor)?
![image](https://jmeter.apache.org/images/screenshots/xpath2_extractor.png)

Jmeter XPath2 Extractor is a post-processor element that allows you to extract values from the server response using XPath 2.0 expressions

XPath 2.0 is an extension of XPath 1.0 that supports more data types, operators, functions, and expressions. It can be used to parse XML or (X)HTML responses and store the extracted values in JMeter variables for later use

To use XPath2 Extractor, you need to add it as a child element of the sampler that produces the response you want to parse. Then you need to configure the following settings:

- `Reference Name`: the name of the JMeter variable that will hold the extracted value.
- `XPath Query`: the XPath 2.0 expression that matches the value you want to extract.
- `Default Value`: the value to use if no match is found or an error occurs.
- `Match No.`: the number of matches to return. 0 means random, -1 means all.

For example, if you have a sampler that produces an XML response like this:
```XML
<root>
    <books>
        <book id=“1” title=“The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” author=“Douglas Adams”/>
        <book id=“2” title=“The Lord of the Rings” author=“J.R.R. Tolkien”/>
        <book id=“3” title=“1984” author=“George Orwell”/>
    </books>
</root>
```
And you want to extract the title of the book with the lowest id, you can add an XPath2 Extractor with the following settings:

- Reference Name: book_title
- XPath Query: min(/root/books/book/@id)/…/@title
- Default Value: NOT_FOUND
- Match No.: 1
Then you can use `${book_title}` in other elements to refer to the extracted value, which will be *“The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy”* in this case.

## [Boundary Extractors](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#Boundary_Extractor):
![img for BE](https://jmeter.apache.org/images/screenshots/extractor/boundary_extractor.png)
Jmeter’s Boundary Extractor is a post-processor element that allows you to extract values from the server response using left and right boundaries.

Boundary Extractor is similar to Regular Expression Extractor, but instead of using a regular expression to match the value you want to extract, you just need to provide the left and right boundaries of the value. This can be easier and faster than using regular expressions, especially for simple cases.

To use Boundary Extractor, you need to add it as a child element of the sampler that produces the response you want to parse. Then you need to configure the following settings:

- `Name`: the name of the post-processor
- `Comments`: any comments or notes about the post-processor
- `Apply to`: the scope of the post-processor, whether it applies to main sample only, main sample and sub-samples, sub-samples only, or a specific JMeter variable
- `Field to check`: the part of the response to check, whether it is body, body (unescaped), body as a document, headers, URL, or code
- `Name of created variable`: the name of the JMeter variable that will store the extracted value
- `Left boundary`: the text that appears immediately before the value you want to extract
- `Right boundary`: the text that appears immediately after the value you want to extract
- `Match No.`: the number of matches to return, 0 for random match, -1 for all matches

For example, if you have a sampler that produces an HTML response like this:

```HTML
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Welcome to JMeter</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>JMeter is a powerful tool for load testing</h1>
        <p>You can use JMeter to test web applications, web services, databases, and more.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```
And you want to extract the text inside the `h1` tag, you can add a Boundary Extractor with the following settings:

- Name: Extract h1 text
- Comments: none
- Apply to: Main sample only
- Field to check: Body
- Name of created variable: h1_text
- Left boundary: <h1>
- Right boundary: </h1>
- Match No.: 1

Then you can use ${h1_text} in other elements to refer to the extracted value, which will be “JMeter is a powerful tool for load testing” in this case.

#### Extract multiple values
To extract multiple values with Boundary Extractor, you need to set the `Match No.` to -1. This will return all the matches that are found between the left and right boundaries. The extracted values will be stored in JMeter variables with an underscore and an index number appended to the variable name. For example, if the variable name is foo, the first match will be stored in ${foo_1}, the second match in ${foo_2}, and so on. The total number of matches will be stored in ${foo_matchNr}.

For example, if you have a sampler that produces an HTML response like this:

```HTML
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Books</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <ul>
            <li>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</li>
            <li>The Lord of the Rings</li>
            <li>1984</li>
            <li>Harry Potter</li>
            <li>The Hunger Games</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
</html>
```

And you want to extract all the book titles inside the li tags, you can add a Boundary Extractor with the following settings:

- Name: Extract book titles
- Comments: none
- Apply to: Main sample only
- Field to check: Body
- Name of created variable: book_title
- Left boundary: <li>
- Right boundary: </li>
- Match No.: -1

Then you can use `${book_title_1}`, `${book_title_2}`, `${book_title_3}`, etc. in other elements to refer to the extracted values. The total number of matches will be stored in `${book_title_matchNr}`, which will be `5` in this case.

## [Result Action Handler](https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#Result_Status_Action_Handler):

![Result_action_handler_GUI](https://jmeter.apache.org/images/screenshots/resultstatusactionhandler.png)

|Attribute|Description|Required|
|--|--|--|
|Name|Descriptive name for this element that is shown in the tree.||
|Action to be taken after a Sampler error|Determines what happens if a sampler error occurs, either because the sample itself failed or an assertion failed. The possible choices are: `Continue` - ignore the error and continue with the test; `Start next thread loop` - does not execute samplers following the sampler in error for the current iteration and restarts the loop on next iteration; `Stop Thread` - current thread exits; `Stop Test` - the entire test is stopped at the end of any current samples.; `Stop Test Now` |No|

#### Some sample for using each option to understand how using this element
Result Status Action Handler is a post-processor element that allows you to take an action after a sampler error, either because the sample itself failed or an assertion failed

Some possible scenarios for using each option are:

- `Continue`: use this option when you want to ignore minor errors and proceed with the test execution. 
> For example, if you have a sampler that checks a web page for a specific element and you don’t care if it is missing or not, you can use this option to continue with the test.
- `Start Next Loop`: use this option when you want to skip the rest of the current loop and start a new one. 
> For example, if you have a loop that performs some actions on a web page and you encounter an error that prevents you from completing the loop, you can use this option to start a new loop with a fresh page.

- `Stop Thread`: use this option when you want to stop the current thread and exit the thread group. 
> For example, if you have a thread group that simulates a user login and performs some actions on a web site and you encounter an error that invalidates your session, you can use this option to stop the thread and avoid further errors.
- `Stop Test`: use this option when you want to stop the entire test at the end of any current samples. 
> For example, if you have a test that checks some critical functionality of a web site and you encounter an error that indicates a major failure, you can use this option to stop the test and report the issue.
- `Stop Test Now`: use this option when you want to stop the entire test abruptly and interrupt any current samples. 
> For example, if you have a test that checks some security features of a web site and you encounter an error that exposes a serious vulnerability, you can use this option to stop the test immediately and alert the security team.
- `Break Current Loop`: use this option when you want to exit from the current loop and continue with the next element in the test plan. 
> For example, if you have a loop that performs some optional actions on a web page and you encounter an error that makes them unnecessary, you can use this option to break from the loop and move on.
- `Go to next iteration of Current Loop`: use this option when you want to start the next iteration of the current loop without executing the remaining elements in the loop. 
> For example, if you have a loop that performs some repetitive actions on a web page and you encounter an error that affects only one iteration, you can use this option to skip it and try again.
